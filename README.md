# Boat_RPi
This repository contains the code and files that make up the entire design of a remote-controlled boat with a vision system. As initially conceived, the project included:
- Raspberry Pi 4B - the minicomputer received messages sent by the user from the application and based on them controlled the entire platform. In the other direction, the RPi sent a vision from the camera located on the boat. The RPi was supposed to process the image, make a detection and then send the message back.
- Mobile application - control of the boat was done wirelessly via a mobile application
- Electronic part - circuit diagram
- Mechanical part - 3D model, which was realized using a 3D printer
